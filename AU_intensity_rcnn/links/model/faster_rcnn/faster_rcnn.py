class FasterRCNN(chainer.Chain):

    """Base class for Faster R-CNN.

    This is a base class for Faster R-CNN links supporting object detection
    API [#]_. The following three stages constitute Faster R-CNN.

    1. **Feature extraction**: Images are taken and their \
        feature maps are calculated.
    2. **Region Proposal Networks**: Given the feature maps calculated in \
        the previous stage, produce set of RoIs around objects.
    3. **Localization and Classification Heads**: Using feature maps that \
        belong to the proposed RoIs, classify the categories of the objects \
        in the RoIs and improve localizations.

    Each stage is carried out by one of the callable
    :class:`chainer.Chain` objects :obj:`feature`, :obj:`rpn` and :obj:`head`.

    There are two func :meth:`predict` and :meth:`__call__` to conduct
    object detection.
    :meth:`predict` takes images and returns bounding boxes that are converted
    to image coordinates. This will be useful for a scenario when
    Faster R-CNN is treated as a black box legacy, for instance.
    :meth:`__call__` is provided for a scnerario when intermediate outputs
    are needed, for instance, for training and debugging.

    Links that support obejct detection API have method :meth:`predict` with
    the same interface. Please refer to :func:`FasterRCNN.predict` for
    further details.

    Args:
        extractor (callable Chain): A callable that takes a BCHW image
            array and returns feature maps.
        head (callable Chain): A callable that takes
            a BCHW array, RoIs and batch indices for RoIs. This returns class
            class scores.
        mean (numpy.ndarray): A value to be subtracted from an image
            in :meth:`prepare`.
        min_size (int): A preprocessing paramter for :meth:`prepare`. Please
            refer to a docstring found for :meth:`prepare`.
        max_size (int): A preprocessing paramter for :meth:`prepare`.
        loc_normalize_mean (tuple of four floats): Mean values of
            localization estimates.
        loc_normalize_std (tupler of four floats): Standard deviation
            of localization estimates.
